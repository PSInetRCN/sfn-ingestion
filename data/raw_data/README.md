This folder is to contain the data and metadata .xlsx files received from SAPFLUXNET.
Do not modify any of the .xlsx files in this folder.
Excel tends to change formats and do other weird things when you open a file, so if you open a file in Excel, *do not save any changes* when you close it.
These files should stay out of git.
