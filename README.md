# sfn-ingestion

Scripts to process data from SAPFLUXNET and prepare it for addition to PSInet.

## Setup

You will need to download the raw data files from Box. 
Renata will send you a download script.
Save these files to `data/raw_data`.
Once downloaded, do not modify these files directly.

## Use

Beginning with the template script in `scripts/template_script.R`, process each dataset into the PSInet format.
Write the processed .csv files to `data/cleaned_data`.
Share the .csv files over Box. (Renata will provide a link).
